Using the back of a spoon, lightly crack shells, keeping shells intact (this creates veins). Carefully return eggs to boiling liquid and cook for a further 2 minutes. Remove pan from heat and set aside to cool in liquid (residual heat will continue cooking eggs). Chill for at least 2 hours or overnight. Discard liquid. Peel eggs and set aside.<br><span>2.</span> Cook the noodles according to packet instructions, then drain and refresh in iced water.

Add half the mushrooms, then season and cook for 3 minutes or until slightly charred. Add garlic and cook for 30 seconds or until fragrant, then transfer to a bowl.
